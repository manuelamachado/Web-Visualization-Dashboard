# Web Visualization Dashboard 


Created a visualization dashboard website using HTML and CSS and visualizations we've created in a past assignment. 

Created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. It has a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them (tables).

### Website Requirements


* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Used a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive tables containing the data used in the visualizations.
* The nav bar has similar behavior as the screenshots ["Navigation Menu" section](#navigation-menu) 

Website must be deployed to github pages: https://manuelamachado.github.io/Web-Visualization-Dashboard/
